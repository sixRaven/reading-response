            I am especially interested in the narrative in which the author describes the duality of websites: “My favorite aspect of websites is their duality: they’re both subject and object at once.” And “When you put energy into a website, it turns the website helps from your own identity” 
        </p>

            At the first glance, I thought it was something unnecessary to bring up. As we can always say “When you put energy into a painting/poem/calligraphy/etc., it turns the painting/poem/calligraphy/etc. helps from your own identity”

       <div class="paracontainer3">
            <p class="response" id="response3">But later, I realized there is a     reason to think that way. Thanks to the power of computation,       website is far more flexible and interactive than any medium        before. Therefore, a website can be a much more comprehensive       representation of one’s identity. In addition, compared with        fields such as painting, music, literature, making a website is     more accessible to the majority of people and requires less         specificity.

            These words made me re-think about the meaning of a website of MINE and reminded me of the lecture about “stop drawing dead fish”- What is a live fish for you when it comes to create in the world of computation and internet? And what kind of fish are you?
